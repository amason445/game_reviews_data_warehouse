# Video Game Data Warehouse Project

## Project Summary
This repository contains an academic project that I build for a capstone course during my Master of Data Science program at Regis University. This project contains ETL and SQL for a data warehouse I built using data from Rawg.io's public API. The final product is a star schema I built using their video game reviews and meta data. I also wrote SQL Views with this data warehouse and connected to Microsoft's PowerBI for visualizations. This repository contains artifacts from the project including the source code, raw data and sample visualizations. It also contains documentation explaining the database architecture and ETL process.

## Data Source: Rawg.io
Rawg.io is a large, public database that collects and maintains information about video games and video game ratings. Rawg.io also provides a publicly available API. The API follows the REST architecture and their API leverages HTTP and returns JSON Documents
